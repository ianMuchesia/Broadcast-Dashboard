Broadcast System Dashboard - Component Analysis & Design Decisions
Overview
This document explains the design decisions and data manipulation techniques used in creating the dashboard components. The JSON data represents a broadcast or media production environment with two main data structures:

deviceTypes: Information about different device types and their counts
panelsInWorkstations: Information about panels installed in workstations

## Overview
This document explains the design decisions and data manipulation techniques used in creating the dashboard components. The JSON data represents a broadcast or media production environment with two main data structures:

- **deviceTypes**: Information about different device types and their counts
- **panelsInWorkstations**: Information about panels installed in workstations

## Data Structure Analysis

```json
"deviceTypes": {
  "totalCount": 260,
  "countByType": {
    "evertz_mv": 1,
    "evertz_multiviewercontrol": 1,
    "PackagerAuto": 109,
    /* many more device types... */
  }
}
```

- The structure contains a total count (260) and a mapping of device types to their individual counts
- There are over 200 different device types with varying counts
- Some device types have very high counts (e.g., "CP-1000E": 210), while others have just 1 or 2 instances


## Panels in Workstations Data

```json
"panelsInWorkstations": {
  "totalCount": 954,
  "workStationCountByPanel": {
    "ringmaster_packaging/package_router": 198,
    "ringmaster_packaging/arrivals_board": 188,
    /* many more panels... */
  }
}
```

- The structure contains a total count (954) and a mapping of panel types to their counts
- Panel names use a path-like structure with categories (e.g., "studio_1/video_xy_mapped")
- Some panels appear in many workstations, while others are rare or unused (value of 0)
- There are empty key entries ("": 170) that need special handling


## Dashboard Component Design Rationale

### Main Dashboard Component
Design Decision: Create a container component that fetches data and manages overall layout.

Rationale:
- Separates data fetching concerns from presentation components
- Provides loading and error states for better UX
- Uses a grid layout for responsive design across different screen sizes
- Organizes visualizations logically based on their importance and relationship

### Summary Cards Component
Design Decision: Display four key metrics in card format at the top of the dashboard.
